# Goals :

- To build Website for an innovative space exploration venture selling tickets for a flight to the stars. The price is $150,000 per seat.

- The Customer is based in Singapore and the company is based in the US. The high price tag makes accepting credit cards and wire transfers expensive for the business and a hassle for the customer.

- To solve this, use Rapyd’s virtual accounts API


# Functionalities:
- Request Virtual Accounts for payments
